		<h2>Founder</h2>

		<p>The founders of ACECORE are two brothers whose passion for computers as mere teenagers, led them to start a small enterprise business. It was in the early 2000’s, that they engaged themselves with the selling of Computer Peripherals within a network of friends. They aspired to greater heights when they saw their previously home-based business develop successfully. <br>

		ACECORE Technologies (Pvt) Ltd was registered as a private limited liability company in 2019, and since then the company has expanded rapidly diversifying into the marketing and distribution of an array of IT products. <br>

		

		The rapid advancement within ACECORE is due to the principles of Innovation and Technology which has always been an inspiration to everyone within the company, this in turn has paid great dividends in ACECORE being one of the leading companies in Sri Lanka’s IT industry. <br>

		Possessing a wealth of experience in the fields of distribution and technology, ACECORE is firmly placed in becoming a market leader in the distribution of 3C Solutions (Computers, Communications and Consumer electronics). <br>
